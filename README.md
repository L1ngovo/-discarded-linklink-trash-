# linklink

- *Maybe there will be some introductions if the project is successful.*
- *Why write in English? It might look more professional.*
- *The project has been aborted*



## A few digressions

​	It was a project that was going to die.

​	At first, I wanted to familiarize myself with vue3, but then I got the idea to make a LinkGame so that I wouldn't be bored on the subway every day when I got home from work. 

​	So far, nothing has been written. 

​	Do not look at the code, or you will get a serious mental shock, this is just my own crazy place. 

​	This one uses a translation app. 

​	Forget it. 

​	:D



​	This project began on August 17, and now there are more than ten days, among which I have written some things and also checked some information, which can be regarded as learning a little bit of new things. 

​	But now I have to announce that the project is dead. 

​	Haha.

​	I'm not interested in this anymore. I found something new. 

​	:D

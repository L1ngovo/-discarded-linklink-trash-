# linklink

- *Maybe there will be some introductions if the project is successful.*
- *Why write in English? It might look more professional.*



## A few digressions

​	It was a project that was going to die.

​	At first, I wanted to familiarize myself with vue3, but then I got the idea to make a LinkGame so that I wouldn't be bored on the subway every day when I got home from work. 

​	So far, nothing has been written. 

​	Do not look at the code, or you will get a serious mental shock, this is just my own crazy place. 

​	This one uses a translation app. 

​	Forget it. 

​	:D
